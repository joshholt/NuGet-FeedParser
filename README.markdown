#  Nuget-Feedparser - Robust RSS, Atom, RDF and now NuGet feed parsing in Node.js 
      
This module adds methods for RSS, Atom, RDF and now NuGet feed parsing in node.js using Isaac Schlueter's [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) parser.

## Requirements

- [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js)
- [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request)

## Installation

    npm install nuget-feedparser

## Example

```javascript
var FeedParser = require('nuget-feedparser')
  , parser

parser = new FeedParser();

parser.on('article', function(article){
    console.log('Got article: %s', JSON.stringify(article));
});

parser.parseFile('./feed');
```

This is basically `node-feedparser` but I have added the ability to grab package properties from the NuGet Package feed.
